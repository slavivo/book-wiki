Magic is not limited to the four elements as commonly taught.</p><p>There exists a fifth element\u2014spirit or aether\u2014that connects all things. Those who can tap into this connection display abilities far beyond traditional elemental manipulation. They can influence minds, see distant places, and even predict possible futures.</p><p>The Academy seems unaware of\u2014or deliberately conceals\u2014this knowledge.</p>"
