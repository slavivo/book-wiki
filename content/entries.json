But fate has a way of pushing us down unexpected paths.</p><p>When I discovered the strange crystal in the mountains of Eldrath, I could not have known how it would change everything. This book shall serve as my record of all I learn about the magical systems of our world, the creatures that inhabit it, and the ancient powers that still linger in forgotten places.</p><p>As I uncover more secrets, I will add to these pages. Perhaps someday, another seeker will find this tome useful in their own quest for understanding.</p><p>I have organized this compendium into sections based on my discoveries. Navigate through the contents to explore what I have learned thus far.</p><p class=\"reveal\">Be warned - some knowledge comes with a price. The sections contain information that may be dangerous to the unprepared mind.</p><p>~ <em>Lyra Moonshadow, Arcane Scholar</em></p>"
