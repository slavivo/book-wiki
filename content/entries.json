My journey began as a simple scholar at the Academy, content with studying the theories of others. But fate has a way of pushing us down unexpected paths.</p><p>When I discovered the strange crystal in the mountains of Eldrath, I could not have known how it would change everything. This book shall serve as my record of all I learn about the magical systems of our world, the creatures that inhabit it, and the ancient powers that still linger in forgotten places.</p><p>As I uncover more secrets, I will add to these pages. Perhaps someday, another seeker will find this tome useful in their own quest for understanding.</p><p>I have organized this compendium into sections based on my discoveries.

Unlike the simplified version taught at the Academy, true Elemental Binding involves forming a sympathetic connection with the elemental plane itself.</p><h3>The Four Elements and Their Aspects</h3><p>Fire is not merely flame, but encompasses heat, transformation, and passion. Water includes not just liquid, but mist, ice, and the concepts of flow and change. Earth represents solidity, endurance, growth, and foundation. Air embodies movement, thought, breath, and invisibility.</p><p>The binding ritual requires a focus object that resonates with the element's frequency:</p><ul><li>Fire - Obsidian, forged in flame, works best</li><li>Water - Pearl or mother-of-pearl, shaped by the sea</li><li>Earth - Raw, uncut crystal that has never seen sunlight</li><li>Air - Feather from a creature that spends its life aloft</li></ul><p class=\"reveal\">I have discovered that a fifth element may exist, though its nature eludes me still. In ancient texts, it is referred to only as <span class=\"rune\">ᛖᚦᛖᚱ</span>, the binding force between all other elements.</p><p><span class=\"page-link\" data-index=\"1\">Return to Contents</span></p><div class=\"watermark\">Property of the Royal Arcane Academy</div><div class=\"torn-edge\"></div>"
